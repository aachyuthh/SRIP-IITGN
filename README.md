# SRIP-IITGN

The notebook contains solutions to 3 of the 4 problem statements issued. I've attemted to complete the first 3 problems - namely:
1) Animating Bivariate Normal Distribution
2) Sampling from a multivariate Normal Distribution (without using  jax.random.normal() )
3) Preparing a Neural Network from scratch

The 3rd problem was not completed properly, the number of neurons is each hidden layer was not optimised and the performance metrics other than loss and accuracy were not implemented

The JAX framework was primarily used for this project
